collide.vim
===========

Move your cursor in one direction until it hits a different character.

Why?
----

I'll explain why later. I'm busy right now.

Mappings
--------

There are four mappings: `cdh`, `cdj`, `cdk`, and `cdl`. Notice they start with `cd` (*c*olli*d*e) and end with a direction (`h`, `j`, `k`, or `l`). Each command moves the cursor in the direction specified until it hits a character that is different from the one you started on.

Oh, also
--------

This plugin is not written yet. As I said, I'm busy.
